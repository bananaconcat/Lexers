Junk will be discontinued, I'm extremely happy with the
lessons I've learned from developing this project and
would like to move onto my next project.
Implmenting things ive learnt from this and creating a
cleaner and more complete language will be the goal.
Attempting to learn C and some more complex things.
It was very fun, I believe I learned more from these
10 hours or so over 2 days than I have throughout these
6 or 7 years I've been programming, This will (probably)
be the last commit. It was a good run.
